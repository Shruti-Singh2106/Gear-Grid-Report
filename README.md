- **Project Background**
The purpose of this project is to analyze warehouse sales and inventory movements to uncover actionable insights for operational efficiency and profitability.
The analysis covers customer demographics, product categories, sales performance, revenue drivers, and time trends. The goal is to identify:

Which products and customers drive the highest revenue

Seasonal and monthly sales trends

Customer buying patterns by region and gender

Top and underperforming products

Key cost and pricing metrics per category

This analysis also explores important KPIs for warehouse management including total sales, quantities sold, customer engagement, pricing trends, and geographic distribution of sales.
- **Executive Summary**


- **DATA STRUCTURE AND QUALITY CHECK**
- This project uses a Gold Layer (cleaned & ready-to-use) data warehouse containing three main tables:

gold.fact_sales
Stores transactional sales data, including order date, customer ID, product details, sales amount, quantity sold, and pricing information.

gold.dim_customers
Contains customer profile information such as name, gender, birthdate, and country. Used to segment sales performance by demographics and geography.

gold.dim_products
Contains product attributes such as category, subcategory, cost, and product name. Used for product-level performance analysis.

These tables allow for detailed time series analysis, customer segmentation, and category-based product performance evaluation.
